                	<p>
                    	My goals as an individual never seem to stay the same. Obviously as people grow older their interests change as they are exposed to new concepts and ideas. As a young boy I always wanted to be a marine biologist and survey the ocean's floor. However, as I've grown older the idea seems less practical than before. The possibility is still there, but if I am to try and be successful I would have to greatly adjust my current lifestyle and courses. Based on where I am at this point in time it seems likely that I will pursue a career in the information technology field. By taking web design and development courses I'm gaining knowledge of different coding languages which are vital to computer programmers and others adept in using a computer to its fullest potential. I see myself pursuing a career in the technical assistance unit of a local law enforcement agency. Knowledge on how computers and operating systems work would be crucial for an occupation such as this.

            		<p>
            			I was raised in a family consisting of four children, which means I've had plenty of experience dealing with other people. It also goes without saying that I've had to deal conflict on what seems like a daily basis. Being able to solve problems is a necessary skill no matter which occupational area one wishes to pursue. I spent the majority of my childhood fascinated with science. It was one of those things where I could never read enough books on biology and how things work. Taking apart toys and putting them back together was one of my favorite hobbies when I was younger. When my family got its first computer I was all over it. I enjoyed testing the computer's limits and seeing how far it could go, as well as attempting to figure out how it worked. My sophomore year I enrolled in the web design and development program area at Southwest CTA. During that year I learned some binary code, which is the parent language of modern code. Something as simple as two numbers was capable of representing an entire language and running complex machines. I found the massive amount of data that could be stored in a string of numbers to be fascinating. After learning about binary code, we moved on to learning basic html and css markup. Towards the end of the year, we began moving towards javascript, a concept I still do not fully grasp.

                    	The future could have many different things in store. After high school I want to continue learning about computers and machinery. In order to achieve my goal of working for law enforcement, however, I will need to gain a massive amount on knowledge. This would include learning how different operating systems work and which commands will allow me to take full control of a machine. I will also need to understand how programs are written and operate. One example of a programming language I'll need to learn is Java. Many modern applications and computer games are written using Java. By focusing on things like javascript while I'm still in web design will assist me as they are heavily logic and command string based, which will help me develop an early grasp of the languages many people take for granted.
