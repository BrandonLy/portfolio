    <p>The above picture is of a sketch done in my first year as an automotive student. We were tasked with designing a wooden car that would win in different categories. Some of these categories included speed, style, and uniqueness. Our group decided that we would make at least an attempt to win the speed portion. To do this we focused on creating a simple and aerodynamic car. Due to unforseen circumstances, we never were able to carve the car how we planned. The machine provided by the school ended up breaking, so our design remained nothing more than a concept.
