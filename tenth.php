                The diagram shown above was used to explain how to create a lighter using nothing more than a battery and a gum wrapper. The assignment came about in chemistry class when we were challenged to come up with an experiment that would teach the class about a concept with household items. It sounds simple enough to do, but the actual experiment proved to be a great challenge. In the end we got the lighter to work using an energizer rechargeable battery and a 5 gum wrapper. This experiment was great practice for solving problems. We had to think outside the box in order to solve our problem of the gum wrapper not catching on fire. In the end it was because we were using a copper battery instead of zinc.

                <p>I had an exceptionally good time with the webpage above. In web design we used <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a> to get creative. We didn't have to worry about the html structure of the page, instead we were to design a web page for practice. It was very relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It allowed me to explore the endless things that CSS has to offer. In particular I used opacity and background images for the first time. I also experimented with the different ways to use bullet points (unordered lists). Specifically, I created panda images to use in place fo the bullets.

    <h2>Persuasive Arguments | Spring 2014</h2>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>The paper above was a combination research paper and persuasive essay. We were tasked with coming up with a controversial topic and persuading the audience to join our side. I wrote this particular paper on why grades should still be instituted in school. This is a topic I believed strongly in, so I found it easier to write than other papers in the past. I would consider it much better written than the paper located on my page for freshman year. The MLA format was followed much more strictly and I provided better sources. I hope to continue at a rate faster than this in my last two years of high school.

            <div class="caption">
                <p>The animation you see above was one small part of a larger project. In my animation class we met Ben, an autistic artist with the dream of becoming a children's book author. To help him with his dream my classmates and I set out on a project which ended up lasting nearly six months. We took his children's book, and turned it into a fifteen minute children's cartoon. The final animation can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1KgOoiir2I">click me!</a>. If you want to find out more about Ben go <a href="http://cartoonben.com">here</a></p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>This project was one of the first things I completed in my Animation 1 class. We were given the chance to work with Flash CS6 a few different times that year, and this was an excellent introduction assignment. I learned a lot of different aspects regarding animations in general, especially the squish and squash theory. I also learned that it takes many little things to make one simple object come to life.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>This was another assignment given in my Animation class, but this one was based in Illustrator CS6. This one was especially interesting to me, because I never saw Illustrator as a program for animating. I always thought of it as one of those things where people just draw. But I couldn't have been more wrong. I enjoyed the opportunity to explore Illustrator as a program, mainly because of all the different features that it has. We ended up using the blending options to create the animation pictured above.</p>

    <h2>Ofrendas | Winter 2013</h2>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>This picture was part of a project for my Spanish 3 class. We were creating Ofrendas (a shrine to celebrate someone on the Day of the Dead) to honor various famous people. My group chose to create a memorial for Steve Irwin. In order to honor what he did during his life, we chose to focus on his love for both wildlife and crocodiles. I chose to combine what I'd learned in my Web Class at the beginning of the year and what was happening in my spanish class. The QR code allowed viewers to not only look at the image, but they were also able to access information on Steve Irwin at the same time. For me this was mind blowing, a connection between the digital and physical worlds had been established.</p>

    <h2>Satirical Writing | Spring 2014</h2>

            </div>
            <div class="caption">
                <p>This assignment was done in my Sophomore English class. At the time we had been learning about Satire, which is basically using comedy to address a more serious issue. This was perfect for me because I enjoyed a healthy serving of sarcasm, unlike many of my peers. We chose to address the issues around Southwest by making a mockery of them. The readers generally found the piece to be amusing, but the real intention was to bring awareness of some ridiculous issues around campus. For the first time in my high school career, I had actually made people listen to what I had to say, whether or not they realized it.</p>

    <h2>Operation Sea Lion | Spring 2014</h2>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>Operation Sea Lion was a disaster, as were most of the projects I completed in my World History class. It's hard to convince people they should care about what's happened in the past. This event was one of the most important things that didn't happen during the second world war. By writing about the effects that may have resulted, I hoped to demonstrate that past experiences are important, because of how they shaped today's world. They also are great insight into future events.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>This was another fun assignment from my World History class. My teacher asked us what we would say to aliens if they were waiting outside of Earth's atmosphere. We were allowed one picture to tell them who humans were as of 2014. This was definitely a unique question because of the different trends that were happening. The amount of slang words being created each day, the internet sensations, the cultural norms. Things had begun to change so rapidly that it was a challenge coming up with a description for the human race.</p>
