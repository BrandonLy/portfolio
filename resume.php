<h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>I am pursuing a career with technology as it stands. I would like to work on the development side of things and hopefully share my knowledge with other people. The classes I'm enrolled in have been invaluable in reaching this goal.</p>
<h2>Computer Skills</h2>
    <p>I am currently educated in a few different coding languages. I am most familiar with html, but I also know a bit of CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. </p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Crew Member, Dairy Queen Las Vegas | March 2014 - Present</h3>
    <p>I have been with Dairy Queen since March of 2014. I was hired during a period of open interviews and have stuck around for the time being. On a daily basis I organize the areas around the store and stock. These skills aren’t very practical outside the setting of a fast food restaurant, but there are general skills associated with these. One of the most important being time management. With the exhausting amount of stuff happening at once, time management is crucial. I have learned how to prioritize my daily tasks and complete more than one at once</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
    <p> I’m set to graduate in the summer of 2016 from Southwest Career and Technical Academy. By then I will have spent three years in the Web Design Program, developing my skills alongside my peers. Currently I have a 4.5 weighted GPA.</p>
