            <p>The above picture is of a sketch done in my first year as an automotive student. We were tasked with designing a wooden car that would win in different categories. Some of these categories included speed, style, and uniqueness. Our group decided that we would make at least an attempt to win the speed portion. To do this we focused on creating a simple and aerodynamic car. Due to unforseen circumstances, we never were able to carve the car how we planned. The machine provided by the school ended up breaking, so our design remained nothing more than a concept.

            	<p>This paper was one of the final assignments from my health class freshmen year. We were to research a profession in the medical field. I chose to take a look at anesthesiology. An AA is there to help the anesthesiologist with his duties, but can't actually put anyone under. This was only the third paper I'd ever written in MLA format. Looking back there was much I still needed to learn in order to write the paper properly. However, that's fine because it was a good learning experience and I feel I benefitted greatly.</p>

            	<p>The above video was an assignment in my Spanish 2H class. After recently learning about reflexive verbs and conjugation rules pertaining to them, we were told to create a video showcasing our new skills. The video was to be shown as if we were preparing taking a trip and we were to talk about the daily things we'd have to do. This particular assignment was challenging because when you're working in a group you are more dependent on other people than you would like sometimes. After struggling to get everyone's video clips together, we finally managed to create something that was presentable, and decided to have some fun. The sillier we were, the more we realized that in order to do a good job we needed to relax.

        <h2>Create a PSA | Spring 2013</h2>

            <div class="caption">
            	<p>In my ninth grade biology class we were tasked with creating a PSA that raised awareness for a disease of our choice. The video itself wasn't very well put together, but it was the first time I attempted any form of animation. A project like this set the stage for my sophomore year, where I would spend nearly six months animating a fifteen minute video. The intro is also of significance, because it showed my how hard it is to develop a creative and unique piece of work. After spending an unimaginable time trying to formulate a plan, I was forced to settle for a stock intro in order to meet my deadline. In the future I will no longer take for granted the power of a creative mind.
